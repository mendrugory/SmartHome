SmartHome
=========

SmartHome is a proof of concept which will try to manage your devices with your android phone. The target is not to connect directly the android phone with the devices, in this case an arduino. The actual target is to have a server home which will be the interface between the user devices (android phone) and the home devices (arduino). Using this approach the system will be more scalable, more secure and more isolated.

Note: This is only a PoC, the quality of code can be improved. I have only spent 8 hours.
